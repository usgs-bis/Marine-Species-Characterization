# Marine-Species-Characterization
The [Ocean Biogeographic Information System](http://iobis.org) (OBIS) provides the global database of marine biological observations and measurements linked with environmental data. This analysis uses the geographic areas (exclusive economic zones) summarized by OBIS and the OBIS Application Programming Interface (API). This provisional Biogeographic Analysis Package summarizes the most reported species within each exclusive economic zone observed and reported to the OBIS. The numbers reported are actual presence observations, meaning the absence records are excluded from the summary. Species were compiled by scientific name and aggregated by the class level of the taxonomic hierarchy for summarization purposes.

# Purpose
OBIS began as the data repository for the census of marine life (Ausubel 1999), and has since expanded to become the global database for marine biological observations and measurements. Data in OBIS have been used for many purposes including understanding global patterns of marine biodiversity (Tittensor et al. 2010, Dornelas et al. 2014, Chaudhary et al. 2016), taxonomic assessments (Rees et al. 2017, Panasiuk et al. 2018), and species distribution modeling (Bosch et al. 2017, Asch and Erisman 2018). This analysis provides a visualization of the taxonomic breadth and record count available in OBIS for U.S. Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs). EEZs, and management of biological resources in them, are important to commercial fishing industry, sports fishing, and managers tasked with meeting the needs of mulitple users of these systems. 

# Abstract Stakeholder
Stakeholders for the type of information in this analysis include researchers, data analysts, and resource managers. By looking at this visualization any of those stakeholders could get an initial preview of the data available in OBIS and make basic decisions about the suitability of the data for their needs.


# Inputs
All data for this analysis are served via the OBIS API. The data are summarized by OBIS to exclusive economic zones as defined by OBIS and are therefore considered OBIS Areas. OBIS Area species can be found at http://api.obis.org/v3/area. Then the summarized data for each of these areas can be found at the OBIS API for that area such as http://api.obis.org/v3/statistics/composition/class?areaid=267.
